# **ðŸ§© `Decision Tree Builder (Gini Index)`**

Build decision tree classifiers from categorical datasets using the Gini index. This notebook works with any categorical dataset and provides both textual and graphical tree representations.

ðŸš€ How It Works

Compute Gini Index: Calculates the impurity for each possible attribute split.

Choose Best Attribute: Selects the attribute with the lowest Gini (most homogeneous split).

Recursive Tree Building: Creates child nodes until:

All samples belong to one class, or

No attributes remain for splitting.

Leaf Nodes: Store the predicted class based on majority voting.

âœ¨ Features

Multi-way splits for categorical attributes.

Handles small to medium datasets.

Textual Tree: Easy to read hierarchical structure.

Graphical Tree: Visualize using Graphviz in Colab or Jupyter.

ðŸ“Š Example Use Cases

Predict Job Offers based on CGPA, Practical Knowledge, Communication Skills.

Predict Sunburn risk based on Hair, Height, Weight, and Lotion usage.

ðŸ”§ Usage

Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Specify the target column.

Build the tree:

tree = build_tree(data, target='Job_Offer')
print_tree(tree)          # Text view
graph = visualize_tree_graphviz(tree)
display(Source(graph.source))  # Visual view
